This is the [Wily][] iOS client.

[XCDYouTubeKit][] FTW.

## Future Direction

The App can currently stream music, but we wish to enhance it to also
be able to save the stream offline for later playback. There does not
seem to be any prepackaged solution for it, although there does seem
to be Apple API support in the form of [MTAudioProcessingTap][].

An alternative would be try and use the iOS ready mobile version of
[VLC][Mobile VLC] and augment it with YouTube stream playback.

Apart from playback, the [EchoNest API][] is a potential goldmine of
future ideas.
