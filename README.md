Wily is a mp3 player for your phone.

It was born out of a need to be able to play online music, but in the
background and while the phone is locked. Further, it should be smart
enough to stash away the music streams for later offline playback. As
of now, the [ios](Wily-ios/) client provides a useable experience, and
work on the droid client is underway.
